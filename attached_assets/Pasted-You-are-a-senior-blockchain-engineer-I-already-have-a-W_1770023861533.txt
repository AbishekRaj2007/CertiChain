You are a senior blockchain engineer.

I already have a WORKING React frontend for a decentralized certificate verification app
(CertifyChain). The frontend currently uses a mockContractService.js.

Your task is to generate:
1) A production-quality Solidity smart contract
2) Hardhat deployment setup (testnet only)
3) A real contract service file that REPLACES the mock service
4) Clear integration instructions

⚠️ IMPORTANT CONSTRAINTS:
- Ethereum Sepolia testnet ONLY
- Free tier only (no paid services)
- Do NOT change existing UI components
- Only replace the mock blockchain logic
- Follow frontend-first Web3 architecture

## 🧱 SMART CONTRACT REQUIREMENTS

Language: Solidity ^0.8.x

Contract name: CertificateRegistry

Roles:
- Issuer (contract deployer)
- Public verifier (anyone)

Data model:
- Certificate ID (string or uint)
- Student name
- Course name
- IPFS hash
- Issuer address
- Issued timestamp
- isValid (bool)

Functions:
1) issueCertificate(
     certificateId,
     studentName,
     courseName,
     ipfsHash
   )
   - Only issuer can call
   - Certificate ID must be unique

2) verifyCertificate(certificateId)
   - Public view function
   - Returns all certificate details

3) revokeCertificate(certificateId)
   - Only issuer
   - Marks certificate as invalid (do NOT delete)

Events:
- CertificateIssued
- CertificateRevoked

Security:
- Use require() checks
- No unnecessary complexity
- Gas-efficient mappings

## 🛠 HARDHAT SETUP

Generate:
- hardhat.config.js
- deploy.js script
- Instructions to:
  - Add Sepolia RPC
  - Use MetaMask private key (test wallet)
  - Deploy to Sepolia
  - Get contract address

---

## 🔌 FRONTEND INTEGRATION (VERY IMPORTANT)

I currently have:
src/services/mockContractService.js

Generate:
src/services/contractService.js

This file must:
- Use ethers.js
- Connect to MetaMask signer
- Import contract ABI
- Use deployed contract address
- Implement:
    issueCertificate(data)
    verifyCertificate(certificateId)

⚠️ Function signatures MUST MATCH the mock service
so that UI code does NOT change.

Example:
- mockContractService.js ❌
- contractService.js ✅

---

## 🌐 NETWORK HANDLING

In contractService.js:
- Ensure user is on Sepolia testnet
- Show clear error if wrong network
- Handle:
  - Transaction pending
  - Transaction success
  - Transaction failure

---

## 📄 OUTPUT REQUIREMENTS

- Provide Solidity contract code
- Provide Hardhat files
- Provide contractService.js
- Provide step-by-step deployment instructions
- Explain how to switch from mock → real contract
- Add comments explaining important logic

DO NOT:
- Modify UI components
- Add backend servers
- Use mainnet
- Overcomplicate the contract

This project is for learning + hackathon demo.
