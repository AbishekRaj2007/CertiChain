## Packages
ethers | Blockchain interaction library
framer-motion | Animation library for smooth transitions and effects

## Notes
The application communicates with a Smart Contract on the Sepolia Testnet.
We use `ethers` v6 to interact with the window.ethereum provider (MetaMask).
The contract ABI and address are handled in `src/services/contractService.js`.
